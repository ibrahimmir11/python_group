Welcome to our group. Regardless if you are brand new to programming or more experienced, the rules apply to all members. If you do not understand a point in the rules, simply ask for clarification. **Posts must be directly related to Python**  

### TL;DR on getting help....  
1.  **DO NOT** post unformatted code, pictures of code. Your post will be blocked until you fix it. Fix it == edit your post.  
1.  Use https://www.ppaste.org, https://dpaste.org or similar for your code, copy + paste, then post the link generated into your post.  
1.  Explain the problem, include the exact error message(if an error is raised).  
1.  If you are having a trouble understanding how to get started with a problem, do what all programmers do, **Divide and conquer**. Write out the requirements of the problem, then solve each one.  
1.  Google first, ask second  

### Not following the rules may result in your post being deleted, you being muted, and/or being blocked permanently from the group. 

### Posts seeking help with coding problems, not adhering to the points below will be locked until the OP updates their post with all relevent detail and formatted as per point 3.

01. The **purpose** of international groups is to be a global meeting point. So we need a reference language and this is English.  

02. If you are **New to Python** and need some advice on where to begin learning, start here => [Learning to Program with Python](https://github.com/pythonprogramming-group/python_group/wiki/Learn-to-Program-with-Python)  

03. All members of Python Programming Language Group are expected to follow the [Python Community Code of Conduct.](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)

04. Do not send unsolicated private message to admins or moderators. All questions may be asked on the group wall and answered by any group member. We will not offer help through private messages. Do not send the Admins/Mods unsolicated friend requests.

05. **Posts seeking help about code debugging** include the following:   
     1). A detailed description of the problem;  
     2). A minimal, easily runnable, and well-formatted program that demonstrates your problem;  
     3). The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the full traceback/error message; and    
     4). Do not paste your code into a post, with Python indentation == code. FB removes critical formatting. If your code contains indentation, or is longer than 5 lines, then use of a pastebin is mandatory. 

     **Options for sharing your code in a post:**      
         1). [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3) Repl allows you to run, save code, and share code;  
         2). Use a code pastebin service/website like, https://www.ppaste.org, https://dpaste.org, https://gist.github.com/, etc. Not knowing how to use a paste bin service, is no excuse. Usage is basic, copy + paste, like the name implies. Detailed steps are linked here => [How to Use a Pastebin](https://github.com/pythonprogramming-group/python_group/wiki/How-To-Use-Pastebin); or  
         3). Link to your **github**, or **bitbucket** repo  
           **Notes:**  
           * **Do not upload files**, posts with attachments will be removed without warning; and    
           * You can include a screenshot of your code, provided you have used 1 of the above 3 options. While a picture may be helpful, expecting someone to retype your code to help you is unreasonable.
 
06. **Posts seeking help about a conceptual problem** :   
     1). Get out a piece of paper and pen, or something similar and solve the problem in plain language and/or use a flow chart. Break the problem down into smaller managable parts, solve each smaller part. Then build your program incrementally until the main problem is solved. Some great advice from From Talk Python Episode #114: Empowering developers at the Hidden Genius project: "We always have to [solve] the algorithm first, before we even touch the keyboard."; and    
     2). Explain how you have tried to resolve this on your own, the group is helpful but the group is not a substitute for reading the documentation or searching the web.  

07. Submissions that are ambiguous, simply a link and nothing else will be removed indiscriminately.  

08. If you your question starts **"Can I use Python to make....What is Python used for...."** please go here: [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/). General questions about Python, you should go here first: [Python Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html). Wondering how Python stacks up against other languages [Comparing Python to Other Languages](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/)   

09. Please **do not ask the group to teach you Python or mentor you**. Use the resources available in the [Recommended Resources]((https://github.com/pythonprogramming-group/python_group/wiki/recommended-resources)) to teach yourself. Some struggle is part of learning.  

10. **Easy web search questions are not permitted, and will be removed without warning.** If you search for a topic, and still do not understand, then please explain why.  

11. Posts with **schoolwork, code challenges, with no effort, will be removed without notice**. We like to help, but Zero Effort == Zero Help.  

12. **Commenting on posts** Comments should be related to the post.   
     1). If you want to give meaningful help, please use the approach of trying to guide OP to a solution by asking questions. This will help the OP understand the potential problem in a logical manner, similar to the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). Giving direct answers does not help the OP understand the problem nor the solution;  
     2). Giving solutions to posts requesting help with little or no effort, will result in you being muted for 24 hours or being blocked from the group;   
     3). Please be careful when giving advice to newcomers who are still learning the basics. Keep in mind that many beginner problems are not about getting the answer, but going through the process of solving the problem in a logical way. For example, in many cases reading the CSV is not about CSV it is just used as a teaching tool for iteration and basic problem solving;   
     4). If you want to follow the Post, please refrain from random comments, it just pollutes the thread. Facebook has a simple method to allow you to follow, just select "Turn on notifications for this post"; and  
     5). [Post-Thread Hijacking](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Thread%20Hijacking) will not be tolerated, e.g. asking for help about a problem you are having, etc.. Create a new post.
     6) When helping, if you post code, please use a code service as explained in point 3.  

13. If you need guidance setting up your Python 3 Dev Environment, please read [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python: Your Development Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/env/). Real Python have a good guide as well [Python IDEs and Code Editors (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/).     

14. Posts should not contain multiple questions, please use one post per question or problem.  

15. Job Postings must adhere to the document, [Job Postings](./Job-Postings). 

16. No solicitation or posting of pirated books, software, and/or materials.  

17. The group's purpose is not member self-promotion.  
     1). If your first post is you promoting your youtube channel, personal blog(video or written), Facebook Page/Group, etc. it will likely be your first and last post in the group;  
     2). We support regular member's blogs, etc. once they are vetted for quality; and    
     3). We encourage member's to show project of interest. If you create a project using Python, please ensure to include the link to your code repo on GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab etc..  

18. Posting of reference material, videos, blog posts will be accepted from established members of the group provided the material is current, and of a high quality. We suggest that your topic be new, explaining how to loop for example has been done expertly numerous times already, this is the same for most beginner topics.

19. Questions about Python, life decisions and jobs, this cannot be answered by us. This depends upon many factors, location, etc. And you can research this yourself. Python is very popular and rising. Your first stop should be to go to the source and read about Python, fromÂ python.org. If you have questions about starting a career in technology and programming, check out Reddit's [CSCareerQuestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) as well as their excellent [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index).
